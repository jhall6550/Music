# Welcome to Music Explorations

This is an informational site about music. You can write pages in Markdown, add images, and even embed audio and videos.

## Quick ideas to add
- Pages about genres (rock, jazz, electronic)
- Pages about instruments and how they work
- Small audio examples (short clips) and YouTube embeds
- Interactive visualizations using client-side JavaScript (p5.js / D3)

## Example audio embed
You can store a small MP3 in your repo (e.g., assets/audio/sample.mp3) and embed it like this:

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhall6550/music-site/main/assets/audio/sample.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

(Replace `music-site` with your repo name and upload the MP3 to `assets/audio/sample.mp3`.)

## Next steps
- Add new pages in the `docs/` folder (create files like `genres/rock.md`)
- Edit this site in the GitHub web editor (no Python needed locally)
- Try adding a YouTube video using the normal iframe embed
